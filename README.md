# REAL-Risk-Assessment-
My team and I led a comprehensive risk assessment for the New Meadows School District at 
Boise State University, focusing on enhancing cybersecurity and physical security. Employed 
tools like Tenable Nessus, NIST framework, OSWAP, FERPA, and ISO models to identify and 
prioritize vulnerabilities in the school's infrastructure. Conducted a meticulous vulnerability scan 
of the network, systems, software, and applications, providing strategic recommendations for 
effective security precautions. Additionally, analyzed physical security, identifying blind spots, 
and proposed camera placements and surveillance enhancements. The final report delivers key 
takeaways, mitigation techniques, and recommendations, empowering the district to establish a 
robust security plan addressing both digital and physical vulnerabilities.
